Atomic Habits Note:


definitions:
-atomic:	an extremely small amount of a thing; the single irreducible unit of a larger system (as small as can be)
-habit:		a routine or practice performed regularly; an automatic response to a specific situation


Four-step model of Habits (Four Laws of Behavior Change):
-cue
-craving
-response
-reward

Similarly to B. F. Skinner, "stimulus, response, reward" in 1930s

B. F. Skinner did a great job in explaining how external stimuli influence our habits, but lacks good explanation about
how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior.

Like how external factor can influence ones' behavior and action, internal such as our moods and emotions plays a role as well.

There has been research that found connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behavior.

The book provides a model of the cognitive and behavioral science that accurately account for both external stimuli and 
internal emotions on our habits.
