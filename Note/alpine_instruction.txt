Post-Installation:

$~ doas apk update && doas apk upgrade && doas apk add git
$~ git clone https://github.com/doomking36/alpine-post
$~ git clone https://github.com/doomking36/chadwm-scripts
$~ cd alpine-post/
$~ chmod +x *
$~ ./new_alpine_post_install.sh
$~ ./auto.sh
$~ cd ~/chadwm-scripts
$~ chmod +x final_bar.sh
$~ rm -rf ~/.config/chadwm/scripts/bar.sh 
$~ mv ~/chadwm-scripts/final_bar.sh ~/.config/chadwm/scripts/bar.sh
$~ reboot 




auto.sh needs fixing/improvement:
- Needs to echo $USER into the file instead of having '$USER'
- Fix profile as it has issue in creating it due to 'nonexistent directory'

The fix that I did was editing the auto.sh line 6 from 'cat > "~/.profile" <<EOF' to 'cat > ".profile" <<EOF'
I will add in the script to move it to /home/$USER
